/**
 * `StepSpec` — the TypeScript shape of a workflow step's `spec.json` file.
 *
 * This module defines the schema that every per-step `spec.json` conforms to
 * (Ideation in A.7; Plan, Execution, Evaluation, Memorization in PR B). It
 * also defines the type that A.6's JSON Schema binds via
 * `JSONSchemaType<StepSpec>` — keeping the TypeScript interface and the
 * JSON Schema in lockstep so drift is caught at compile time.
 *
 * Authoritative spec source: `.claude/project/gobbi/design/v050-prompts.md`
 * §Spec Schema. Cross-references:
 *
 * - §Cache-Aware Prompt Ordering — motivates `tokenBudget` five-section model
 * - `v050-state-machine.md` §Predicate Registry — motivates the `condition`
 *   string field on `StepTransition` (a predicate name, resolved to a
 *   TypeScript function at compile time; B.3's codegen will later narrow
 *   this from `string` to a branded `PredicateName` type)
 * - `v050-hooks.md` — motivates `completionSignal` referencing hook event
 *   names like `SubagentStop` and `Stop`
 * - `v050-session.md` — motivates `expectedArtifacts` as filenames the
 *   session directory captures per step
 *
 * Design philosophy:
 *
 * - Every field is `readonly`. A loaded spec is an immutable record.
 * - Collections use `readonly` tuple/array markers so callers cannot mutate.
 * - Dictionaries that key into other parts of the spec (e.g.
 *   `blocks.delegation` keyed by `AgentConfig.blockRef`) use
 *   `Readonly<Record<string, ...>>`.
 * - String fields that will later become branded types (predicate names,
 *   skill IDs, artifact filenames) are left as `string` in A.3b and will
 *   be narrowed by downstream codegen (B.3 for predicate names; A.6 can
 *   choose JSON Schema `pattern` constraints where useful).
 *
 * Runtime-only invariants that live outside the type system:
 *
 * - `tokenBudget.{staticPrefix,session,instructions,artifacts,materials}`
 *   must sum to `1.0` (each ≥ 0). See `TokenBudget`. A.5 enforces at
 *   allocation time; A.6's JSON Schema will need a custom keyword.
 * - Every `StepTransition.condition` must name a predicate registered in
 *   `workflow/predicates.ts`. `gobbi workflow validate` enforces this at
 *   validation time; B.3's codegen will make it a compile-time constraint.
 * - Every `AgentConfig.blockRef` must be a key of `blocks.delegation`.
 *   `gobbi workflow validate` enforces this structurally.
